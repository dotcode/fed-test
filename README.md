FED test
========

This is a simple test to evaluate basic front-end development skills.

In this repo is a file (index.html) where there is duplication of the link text in the title attribute. This is unnecessary, and must be removed. However, we still want a tooltip to appear when the images are hovered over.

Please treat this task like you would any other task at work - feel free to search the web, and try to write code which is easily maintained by others.

Fork this repo, and when you are finished, submit a pull request with your changes. 


Acceptance criteria
-------------------
1. When hovering over the images, a tooltip should appear.
2. There must be no duplication of content.
3. There must be no title attribute used - at all.
4. The solution must not interfere with standard browser behaviour. 
5. HTML and CSS must validate.
6. The principles of Progressive Enhancement must not be violated.
7. Browser support: YUI GBS.

Judging
-------
Your work will be judged against the acceptance criteria above, and also take into account the time elapsed between the link being sent to you, and you submitting your pull request. I will add a comment to your pull request noting the time taken.

Obviously the faster the better, but the work MUST meet the acceptance criteria. I'm not interested in bad work, done quickly ;)
